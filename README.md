Thanks for finding yourself at my Github page! I treat Github like my second website and am constantly updating readmes and projects that I am currently invloved in. Also check out [my blog](https://flawnson.github.io/) if you're curious to know what I've been dabbling in most recently besides code.

- 🧬 Recently I've been working with my good friend [Albert Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albert-yq-wang/) on [Comend](https://www.comendcare.com/), we build software for rare disease patient groups. We've launched [Librarey](https://www.librarey.com/), and are actively developing [Scimantic](http://scimantic.com/) as well as new products. Our mission is to build the operating system for citizen science by building a suite of tools to help patient groups do what they do better.
- 🍵 I'd love to collaborate on any related projects or any compelling ideas that I can take up, or just chat and answer questions about stuff outside programming.
