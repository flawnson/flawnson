Thanks for finding yourself at my Github page! I treat Github like my second website and am constantly updating readmes and projects that I am currently invloved in.

- I'm currently working on ML methods in chemistry with Kebotix Inc (Boston MA, USA). I work remotely from Toronto/Waterloo at the moment.
- On my own time I'm working on a project with [Kevin Shen](https://github.com/kshen3778) involving a meta-leraning heuristic using neural networks to generate their own weights.
- I'd love to collaborate on any related projects or any compelling ideas that I can take up (most recently I've begun a new initiative involving queueing and scheduling theory).
- Ask me about Graph Neural Networks and other unconventional neural information model architectures.
