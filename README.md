Thanks for finding yourself at my Github page! I treat Github like my second website and am constantly updating readmes and projects that I am currently invloved in.

- ðŸ§ª I'm currently working on ML methods (mostly graph and language models) for chemical and materials discovery with [Kebotix Inc](https://www.kebotix.com/) (Boston MA, USA). I work remotely from Toronto/Waterloo at the moment.
- ðŸ¤– On my own time I'm working on a project with [Kevin Shen](https://github.com/kshen3778) involving - at an oversimplified level - a meta-leraning heuristic using neural networks to generate their own weights.
- â˜• I'd love to collaborate on any related projects or any compelling ideas that I can take up (most recently I've begun a new initiative involving [queueing](https://queue-it.com/blog/queuing-theory/#:~:text=Queuing%20theory%20(or%20queueing%20theory,customer%2C%20job%2C%20or%20request.) and [scheduling](https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Scheduling_theory#:~:text=Scheduling%20theory%20includes%20questions%20on,computer%20systems%2C%20construction%2C%20etc.) theory) or just chat and answer questions about stuff outside programming.
